# Looking Back
We made this as what we thought was a cool idea for Pennapps in 2014.  <br />
Lessons Learned: <br />
* It wasn't a cool idea
* Make sure you know your teammates for a hackathon if you want to win
* ^ If you don't know your teammates, make sure they'll actually stay at your table for more than 2% of the time
* ^^ If you go to a hackathon, don't try to win. Just build some cool shit.
